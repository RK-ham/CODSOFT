## What I Did in This Project:
1. Loaded the Titanic dataset using pandas  
2. Cleaned missing data (like Age) and removed unwanted columns  
3. Visualized survival rate by gender  
4. Converted text data to numeric (Sex column)  
5. Trained Logistic Regression model  
6. Evaluated model using accuracy  
7. Plotted heatmap of feature correlations  

---

## Libraries Used:
- `pandas`  
- `seaborn`  
- `matplotlib`  
- `scikit-learn`

---

## Accuracy Achieved:
**~79.89%** survival prediction accuracy using Logistic Regression.

---

## File Format:
- `.ipynb` file (Google Colab notebook)
- Includes all code and graph output

---

##  Notes:
This task was done as part of the **CodSoft Data Science Internship**.  
I used **Google Colab** and **YouTube (Unlisted)** to keep the video visible only to the CodSoft team.
